    "**Common Procedure:** Consists on using a pre-determined set of words (dictionary) that identifies the categories you want to classify documents. With this dictionary, you can do a simple search through the documents, count how many times these words appear, and use some type of aggregation function to classify the text. For example: \n",

    "- Positive or negative, for sentiment\n",
    "- Sad, happy, angry, anxious... for emotions\n",
    "- Sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, racism... for hate speech\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are the most basic strategy to classify documents. Its simplicity requires some unrealistic assumptions (for example related to ignoring contextual information of the documents). However, the use of dicitionaries have one major advantage: it allows for a bridge between qualititative and quantitative knowledge. You need human experts to build good dictionaries.  "

    "## Pre-Trained Large Language Models: Hugging Face\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past few years, the field of natural language processing  has undergone through a major revolution. As we first saw, the early generation of NLP models was based on the idea of converting text to numbers through the use of document-feature matrix relying on the bag-of-words assumptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the past ten-years, we have seen the emergence of a new paradigm using deep-learning and neural networks models to improve on the representation of text as numbers. These new models move away from the idea of a bag-of-words towards a more refined representation of text capturing the contextual meaning of words and sentences. This is achieved by training models with billions of parameters on text-sequencing tasks, using as inputs a dense representation of words. These are the famous word embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most recent innovation on this revolution has been the Transformers Models. These models use multiple embeddings (matrices) to represent word, in which each matrix can capture different contextual representations of words. This dynamic representation allow for higher predictive power on downstream tasks in which these matrices form the foundation of the entire machine learning architecture. For example, Transformers are the the core of the language models like Open AI's GPTs and Meta's LLaMa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformers use a sophisticated architecture that requires a huge amount of data and computational power to be trained. However, several of these models are open-sourced and are made available for us on the web through a platform called [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/). Those are what we call **pre-trained large language models**. At this point, there are thousands of pre-trained models based on the transformers framework available at hugging face. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you find a model that fits your task, you have two options: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use the model architecture: access the model through the transformers library, and use it in you predictive tasks.** \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fine-Tunning:** this is the most traditional way. You will get the model, give some data, re-train the model slightly so that the model will learn patterns from your data, and use on your predictive task. By fine-tuning a Transformers-based model for our own application, we can improve contextual understanding and therefore task-specific performance\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see example of the first for sentiment analysis. If you were to do build a full pipeline for classification, you would probably need to fine-tune the model. To learn more about fine-tunning, I suggest you to read: \n",
    "\n",
    "- here on hugging face: https://huggingface.co/blog/sentiment-analysis-python\n",
