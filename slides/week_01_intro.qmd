# Motivation

## Rise of the digital information age

```{r fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/digital.jpeg") 
```

## Official Documents: Congressional Speeches, Bills, Press Releases, Transcripts, from all over the world!!

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/RTS10VM4.jpg") 
```

## Social Media

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/redes.png") 
```

## The internet: News, Comments, Blogs, etc...

## What is this class about?

-   For many years, social scientists use text in their analysis
   - Mostly through [in-depth]{.red} reading of documents. 
   - [Close Reading]{.red}. Humans are great at this!

-   Digital Revolution: 
    - Production of text increased 
    - The capacity to analyze them at scale as well. 

- This class covers methods (and many applications) of using text as data to [answer social science problems]{.red} and [test social science theories]{.red}

-   Computational Linguistics \~ [Distant Reading]{.red}. Computers are better at understanding patterns, classify and describe content across millions of documents. 


<!-- ## Text as the new scientific frontier

[**Data:**]{.red}

-   lots of it on the web + archives + ocr methods to process them

[**Methods:**]{.red}

-   unstructured data needs to be harvested and modeled.

[**Social science:**]{.red}

-   politicians give speeches, thinkers write articles, nations sign treaties, users connect on Facebook etc.

[**Focus on applications of computational linguistics to social science problems**]{.red} -->

## Principles of Text Analysis (GMB Textbook)

-   [**Principle 1:**]{.red} Social science theories and substantive knowledge are essential for research design

-   [**Principle 2:**]{.red} Text analysis does not replace humansâ€”it augments them.

-   [**Principle 3:**]{.red} Building, refining, and testing social science theories requires iteration and cumulation.

-   [**Principle 4:**]{.red} Text analysis methods distill generalizations from language. (all models are wrong!)

-   [**Principle 5:**]{.red} The best method depends on the task. (Qualitative knowledge)

- [**Principle 6:**]{.red}  Validations are essential and depend on the theory and the task


## Challenges I: Text is an unstructure data source

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/article/advancing-text-mining/figures/dfm.png")
```


## Challenge II: Text is High dimensionality

From [Gentzkow et al 2017](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/text-as-data.pdf):

- sample of documents, each $n_L$ words long, drawn from vocabulary of $n_V$ words.

- The unique representation of each document has dimension $n_{V}^{n_L}$ .
   - e.g., a sample of 30-word ($n_L$) Twitter messages using only the one thousand most common words in the English language
   - Dimensionality = $1000^{30}$ 
   - As a matrix: $M^{1000}_{n_tweets}$

- Most of what you learned in statistics so far does not equip you to deal with this curse of dimensionality. 

## Text-as-Data Workflow

:::{.nonincremental}
[**Acquire textual data:**]{.red}

  -   Existing corpora; scraped data; digitized text
:::

## Text-as-Data Workflow
:::{.nonincremental}

[**Map Documents to a numerical representation _M_**]{.red}

  -   Bag-of-words (sparse vectors)
  -   Embeddings (dense vectors)
  -   Reduce noise, capture signal
:::

## Text-as-Data Workflow

:::{.nonincremental}

[**Map _M_ to predicted values $V^{*}$ of unknown outcomes V**]{.red}

  -   Descriptive Analysis
  -   Classify documents into unknown categories
      -   Topic models
  -   Classify documents into known categories
      -   Dictionary methods
      -   Supervised machine learning
      -   Transfer-Learning - use models trained in text for other purposes
  -   Scale documents on latent dimension:
:::      

## Text-as-Data Workflow
:::{.nonincremental}

[**Use $V^{*}$ in subsequent analysis with other data sources**]{.red}
    
  - This is where social science happens! 
:::        

## Assume you already did it!

-   [**Acquire textual data:**]{.red} Existing corpora; scraped data; digitized text

## Overview of TAD Methods

- [**Descriptive inference:**]{.red} how to convert text to matrices, vector space model, bag-of-words, dissimilarity measures, diversity, complexity, style.

- [**Supervised techniques:**]{.red} dictionaries, classication, scaling, machine learning approaches.

- [**Unsupervised techniques:**]{.red} clustering, topic models, embeddings.

- [**Special topics:**]{.red} Word embeddings and Large Language Models.

## Some cool applications

-   [Measure text-reuse across thousands of bills from U.S. state legislatures](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psj.12257)

-   [Estimate levels of toxicity of comments from stremming chats platforms during political debates](https://journalqd.org/article/view/2573)

-   [Measure how out-group negative makes things go viral on social media](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2024292118?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed)

-   [Measure the policy target of bills proposals in Mexico](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/electoral-accountability-and-particularistic-legislation-evidence-from-an-electoral-reform-in-mexico/BCFD6B0C73B041C8C410594BDB232DB1)

-   Estimate ideological positions using [who a user follows on Twitter](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/birds-of-the-same-feather-tweet-together-bayesian-ideal-point-estimation-using-twitter-data/91E37205F69AEA32EF27F12563DC2A0A), [what a user share on social media](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19401612211057068), [political manifestos](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/abs/word-embeddings-for-the-analysis-of-ideological-placement-in-parliamentary-corpora/017F0CEA9B3DB6E1B94AC36A509A8A7B), or [just asking ChatGPT to pair-wise compare politicians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12057)

## What this class in not about it...

-   Data acquisition: [no scrapping in class]{.red}. Assume you have learned already.

-   Regular expressions and basic text manipulation.

-   [CS Stuff]{.red}: machine translation, OCR, POS, entity recognition. 
     - Most NLP/CS will focus on developing new algorithms, information retrievel and purely better measurements. 
     - in a productive dialogue with NLP, we will focus on using text for social science research 
        - theoretically driven discovery and measurement
        - integration with social science problems + tabular data.

# Let's take a break!

## Read the syllabus!

```{r}
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 0, 
          left = 0, right = 0,
          top=0,
          padding = "100px",
          margin = "10%",
          font_size = "6em")
```

# Class Logistics

## 

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/schedule_.png")
```

## Class Requirements

-   Assume you all have a intro course in statistics and probability ([**which I know you do**]{.red})

-   [**Math:**]{.red} Basic knowledge of calculus, probability, densities, distributions, statistical tests, hypothesis testing, the linear model, maximum likelihood and generalized linear models is assumed.

-   [**Programming:**]{.red} Functional knowledge of R - main programming language of the course. Some Python at the end.

    -   R is excellent for text analysis, and for some social science applications, better than Python

    -   Free, and massive online community writing packages and extending modeling capabilities.

    -   We will divide our learning between using `tidytext` and `quanteda` for text analysis.

    -   [Download RStudio IDE]{.red}!


## How to do well in the class?

I designed this course as [PhD style seminar]{.red}:

-   So far, you learned a lot of DS techniques (DS I, DS II, DS III)

-   You haven't dig deep enough in a particular field. [That's what electives are for!]{.red}

-   [**Heavy on readings**]{.red} - Lot's of applied and technical readings.

-   [Do the readings before class]{.red}

-   Substantive readings are [especially important]{.red}, because they'll help you understand what an interesting question looks like  -- [in social science/public policy]{.red}.

-   Plan ahead -- [particularly for the replication exercise]{.red}

-   If you have a corpus you want work with, please bring it to class!

## What our classes will look like.

This is a one meeting per week class. You should expect: 

- Between [1h-1.5h]{.red} of lecture based on this week topics + readings

- [Your participation in the lecture is expected]{.red} I will ask your insights about the readings. 

- Break (10min)

- Coding. 
   - Mix of [you]{.red} working through some code I prepared.
   - And I [live-coding]{.red} for you.

## ChatGPT

:::{.nonincremental}
You are allowed to use ChatGPT as you would use google in this class. This means:

-   Do not copy the responses from chatgpt -- a lot of them are wrong or will just not run on your computer

-   Use chatgpt as a auxiliary source.

-   If your entire homework comes straight from chatgpt, I will consider it plagiarism.

-   If you use chatgpt, I ask you to mention on your code how chatgpt worked for you.
