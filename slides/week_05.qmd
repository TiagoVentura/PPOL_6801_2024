## Where are we?

We started from [pre-processing text]{.red} as data, [representing]{.red} text as numbers, and [describing features]{.red} of the text.

Last week, we started learning how to measure concepts in text:

::: fragment
> *Documents pertaining to certain [classes]{.red} and how we can use statistical assumptions to [measure]{.red} these classes*
:::

::: fragment
-   Dictionary Methods
    -   Discuss some well-known dictionaries
-   Off-the-Shelf Classifiers
    -   Perspective API
    -   Hugging Face (only see as a off-the-shelf machines, LMMs later in this course)
:::

## Remember...

::: fragment
-   [Unsupervised Models]{.red}: learning (hidden or latent) structure in [unlabeled]{.red} data.

    -   [Topic Models to cluster documents and words]{.midgray}
:::

::: fragment
-   [Supervised Models]{.red}: learning relationship between [inputs]{.red} and a [labeled set of outputs]{.red}.

    -   Sentiment Analysis, classify if a tweet contains misinformation, etc..
:::

::: fragment
#### In TAD, we mostly use unsupervised techniques for [discovery]{.red} and supervised for [measurement of concepts]{.red}.
:::

# Today: cover the pipeline to [train your own machine learning models]{.red} to classify textual data.

## Assuming:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%"}

```

## Supervised Learning Pipeline for TAD

::: incremental
-   [Step 1:]{.red} label some examples of the concept of we want to measure

    -   [some tweets are positive, some are neutral and some are negative]{.midgray}

-   [Step 2:]{.red} train a statistical model on these set of label data using the [document-feature matrix]{.red} as input

    -   [choose a model (transformation function) that gives higher out-of-sample accuracy]{.midgray}

-   [Step 3:]{.red} use the classifier - some f(x) - to predict unseen documents.

    -   [pick the best out-sample perfirmance]{.midgray}

-   [Step 4:]{.red} use the measure + metadata\|exogenous shocks to learn something new about the world.

    -   [This is where social science happens!]{.midgray}

## Supervised Learning vs Dictionaries

**Dictionary methods:**

-   Advantage: [not corpus-specific]{.red}, cost to apply to a new corpus is trivial
-   Disadvantage: [not corpus-specific]{.red}, so performance on a new corpus is unknown (domain shift)

**Supervised learning:**

-   [Generalization]{.red} of dictionary methods
-   Features associated with each categories (and their relative weight) are [learned]{.red} from the data
-   By construction, ML [will outperform dictionary methods]{.red} in classification tasks, as long as training sample is large enough

# Creating a labeled set

## How to obtain a labeled dataset?

::: incremental
-   **External Source of Annotation:** [someone else labelled the data for you]{.midgray}

    -   Federalist papers
    -   Metadata from text
    -   Manifestos from Parties with well-developed dictionaries

-   **Expert annotation:** [put experts in quotation]{.midgray}

    -   mostly undergrads \~ that you train to be experts

-   **Crowd-sourced coding:** [digital labor markets]{.midgray}

    -   [Wisdom of Crowsds:]{.red} the idea that large groups of non-expert people are collectively smarter than individual experts when it comes to problem-solving

## Crowdsourcing as a research tool for ML

<br> <br> <br>

> Crowdsourcing is now understood to mean using the Internet to distribute a [large package of small tasks]{.red} to a large number of [anonymous workers]{.red}, located around the world and offered small financial rewards per task. The method is widely used for data-processing tasks such as image classification, video annotation, data entry, optical character recognition, translation, recommendation, and proofreading

-   Their task: Manifestos \~ sentences \~ workers:

    -   social\|economic
        -   very-left vs very right

-   Reduce uncertainty by having more workers for each sentence

## General Thoughts

Once we have our training data, we need to pick a classifier. We face these challenges:

::: fragment
-   in text as data, often your DFM has [Features \> Documents]{.red}

    -   identification problems for statistical models
    -   overfitting the data
:::

::: fragment
-   Bias-Variance Trade-off

    -   fit a overly complicated model \~ [leads to higher variance]{.red}
    -   fit a more flexible model \~ [leads to more bias]{.red}
:::

::: fragment
-   Many models:

    -   Naive Bayes
    -   Regularized regression
    -   SVM
    -   k-nearest neighbors, tree-based methods, etc.
    -   Ensemble methods + DL
:::

## Bias and Variance Tradeoff

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./week5_figs/bias_variance.png") 
```

## Train-Validation-Test OR Cross Validation

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./week5_figs/xval.png") 
```

## Many Models

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./week5_figs/ml_models.png") 
```

## But not so different...

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./week5_figs/models.png") 
```

## Regularized OLS Regression

The simplest, but highly effective, way to avoid overfit and improve out-sample accuracy is to add penalty parameters for statistical models:

::: fragment
[**OLS Loss Function :**]{.red}

$$
RSS = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^{J} \beta_j x_{ij} \right)^2 
$$
:::

::: fragment
[**OLS + Penalty:**]{.red}

$$
\text{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^{J} \beta_j x_{ij} \right)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{J} \beta_j^2 \rightarrow \text{ridge regression}
$$

$$
\text{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^{J} \beta_j x_{ij} \right)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{J} |\beta_j| \rightarrow \text{lasso regression}
$$

## Supervised Learning Pipeline for TAD

-   [Step 1: label some examples of the concept of we want to measure]{.midgray}

-   [Step 2 train a statistical model on these set of label data using the document-feature matrix as input]{.midgray}

-   [Step 3: use the classifier - some f(x) - to predict unseen documents.]{.red}

-   [Step 4: use the measure + metadata\|exogenous shocks to learn something new about the world.]{.midgray}

## Evaluating the Performance

|            |       | Predicted |        |       |
|------------|-------|:---------:|:------:|------:|
|            |       |     J     |   ¬J   | Total |
| **Actual** | J     |  a (TP)   | b (FN) |   a+b |
|            | ¬J    |  c (FP)   | d (TN) |   c+d |
|            | Total |    a+c    |  b+d   |     N |

::: incremental
-   **Accuracy**: number correctly classified/total number of cases = (a+d)/(a+b+c+d)

-   **Precision** : number of TP / (number of TP+number of FP) = a/(a+c) .

    -   Fraction of the documents predicted to be J, that were in fact J.
    -   Think as a measure for the estimator

-   **Recall**: (number of TP) / (number of TP + number of FN) = a /(a+b)

    -   Fraction of the documents that were in fact J, that method predicted were J.
    -   Think as a measure for the data

-   **F** : 2 precision\*recall / precision+recall

    -   Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
