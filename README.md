# PPOL 6801 2024

Repository for Georgetown McCourt's School of Public Policy's Text as Data (PPOL 6801) in Spring of 2024


## Course Description

In recent years, the surge in the availability of textual data, ranging from the digitalization of archival documents, political speeches, social media posts, and online news articles, has led to a growing demand for statistical analysis using large volumes of text data. In this course, we will teach students how to analyze and somewhat collect this data from a social science viewpoint. The focus is on understanding the real-world use of text as data rather than just the theory behind it. Students will learn how to acquire text, turn text into data, and analyze it to answer important policy-relevant questions. Each week, we'll go over different methods, like building and using dictionaries, understanding sentiment in text, scaling texts on ideological and policy dimensions, and using machine learning to classify text. Lectures will include hands-on activities, letting students work directly with actual texts, and I strongly encourage students to bring their own data to class. The course aims to equip students with a variety of text analysis techniques that will be valuable for their future work as policy experts and computational social scientists.

While the course covers an interdisciplinary topic, and many of the techniques we discuss have their origins in computer science or statistics, we will spend relatively little time on traditional Natural Language Processing techniques, such as machine translation, optical character recognition, and parts of speech tagging, etc. Although we will touch on Large Language Models (ChatGPT) at the end of the course, we will focus mostly on the practical use of these models through their APIs instead of building up and providing an in-depth understanding of their architecture. 

I assume students taking this class have taken, at minimum, an introductory class in statistics and have basic knowledge of probability, distributions, hypothesis testing, and linear models. The core language and software environment of this course is R. If you are not familiar with R, you will struggle with the assigned exercises. We will also provide some code in Python, but no prior knowledge here is assumed since this will be additional material.
