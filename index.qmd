## Course Description

This course introduces students to the quantitative analysis of text as data. With the increasing availability of large-scale textual data – from government documents and political speeches to social media and online news – the potential to extract meaningful insights from text has expanded greatly. In this course, students will learn to transform text into data and apply it to social science questions and theories. Key topics include text representation, sentiment analysis, scaling text on ideological and policy dimensions, using machine learning for text classification, word embeddings and using Large Language Models (GPT, Bert, Llama, Gemini, etc..) for social science research. Although we will cover LLMs, the focus will be on applied methods and transfer learning rather than an in-depth coverage of building LLMs from scratch. 

The course includes hands-on exercises using real-world data to reinforce lecture content. By the end, students will have a toolkit for text analysis useful in roles as policy experts and computational social scientists. Students should have completed at least an introductory statistics course and have a basic understanding of probability, distributions, hypothesis testing, and linear models. Students are also expected to have experience working with R, the programming language and software environment of this course, and Python for the LLM's components of the course.

## Course Infra-structure

**Class Website:** This class website will be used throughout the course and should be checked on a regular basis for lecture materials and required readings.

**Class Slack Channel:** The class also has a dedicated [slack channel](XXXXXXXXXX). The channel serves as an open forum to discuss, collaborate, pose problems/questions, and offer solutions. Students are encouraged to pose any questions they have there as this will provide the professor the means of answering the question so that all can see the response. If you're unfamiliar with, please consult the following start-up tutorial <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members>. Please follow the [invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/ppol5203fall2023/shared_invite/zt-2159njh4n-S4u1yonz4dA7Zxyo2n3bjA) to be added to the Slack channel.

**Canvas:** A Canvas site <http://canvas.georgetown.edu> will be used throughout the course and should be checked on a regular basis for announcements. Materials will be posted here, and not on canvas, or distributed in class or by e-mail. Support for Canvas is available at (202) 687-4949

## Credits

To build this course, I used materials from Arthur Spirling [Text-as-Data](https://github.com/ArthurSpirling/text-as-data-class-spring2021) Class at NYU, and lab materials from various TA's for his course ([Elisa Wirsching](https://elisawirsching.github.io/), [Lucia Motolinia](https://sites.wustl.edu/luciamotolinia/), [Pedro L. Rodriguez](http://prodriguezsosa.com/), [Kevin Munger](http://www.kevinmunger.com/), [Patrick Chester](https://patrickjchester.com/), [Leslie Huang](https://leslie-huang.github.io/)), Pablo Barbera's [Computational Social Science Seminar](http://pablobarbera.com/POIR613/index.html) seminar, [Brandon Stewart](https://bstewart.scholar.princeton.edu/), [Alex Siegel](https://aasiegel.github.io/website/website-main/), [Chris Bail](https://www.chrisbail.net/), [Sebastian Vallejo](https://www.svallejovera.com/), among others. Their lessons and inspiration are spread throughout all the materials of the course. Thanks!
